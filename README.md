# AWS SA Prep Guide

# Regions and AZ

### **Regions:**

* A **Region** is a geographic location where AWS has data centers.  
* Each region is independent and isolated from others for security and compliance.  
* AWS regions are named after the location, e.g., **us-east-1** (North Virginia), **eu-west-1** (Ireland), **ap-south-1** (Mumbai).

#### **Example:**

* If your users are mostly in Europe, you might choose **eu-west-1** (Ireland) to host your services for lower latency and better performance.

### **Availability Zones (AZs):**

* An **Availability Zone** is one or more isolated data centers within a region.  
* AZs in a region are connected by high-speed private networks, enabling low-latency communication.  
* They are labeled within a region as **us-east-1a**, **us-east-1b**, etc.  
* Using multiple AZs ensures **high availability** because if one AZ fails, others can take over.

#### **Example:**

* In **us-east-1**, there are multiple AZs like **us-east-1a**, **us-east-1b**, etc. You can run your application in **us-east-1a** and have backups in **us-east-1b** to avoid downtime.

# IAM, Users, Groups and Policies

AWS **IAM** (Identity and Access Management) is a service that helps manage access to AWS resources securely. It allows you to create and manage **users**, **groups**, and control their access to AWS services using **policies**.

### **Key Components of IAM:**

1. **IAM Users**:  
   * An **IAM user** is an entity created within AWS to represent a person or application that interacts with AWS resources.  
   * Each user has a unique name within the AWS account and can have their own credentials, such as **passwords** for the AWS Management Console and **access keys** for programmatic access (using the AWS CLI, SDKs, or APIs).  
   * By default, an IAM user has **no permissions**. You must explicitly grant permissions by attaching **policies** to the user.  
   * **Example**:  
     * You can create a user called "JohnDoe" who needs access to manage S3 buckets and another user "DevApp" who needs programmatic access to specific EC2 instances.  
2. **IAM Groups**:  
   * An **IAM group** is a collection of IAM users. It allows you to assign permissions to multiple users at once by attaching policies to the group, rather than assigning policies individually to each user.  
   * Groups simplify the management of permissions for teams or departments.  
   * **Example**:  
     * You could create a group called "Developers" and attach a policy that grants full access to EC2. Any user added to this group will inherit those permissions.  
     * If JohnDoe and JaneSmith are developers, you can add them to the "Developers" group and manage their permissions collectively.  
3. **IAM Policies**:  
   * A **policy** is a JSON document that defines permissions. Policies specify which AWS resources users or groups can access, and what actions they can perform on those resources.  
   * Policies are attached to IAM **users**, **groups**, or **roles** to grant permissions.  
   * AWS provides managed policies (predefined policies) or you can create your own custom policies.  
   * **Policy Structure**:  
     * A policy typically includes:  
       1. **Effect**: `Allow` or `Deny`  
       2. **Action**: The operation (like `s3:PutObject` or `ec2:StartInstances`)  
       3. **Resource**: The AWS resource the action applies to (like a specific S3 bucket or EC2 instance)

{  
  "Version": "2012-10-17",  
  "Statement": \[  
    {  
      "Effect": "Allow",  
      "Action": "s3:ListBucket",  
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket"  
    },  
    {  
      "Effect": "Allow",  
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",  
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::example-bucket/\*"  
    }  
  \]  
}

| `u-12tb1.metal` |  | Oracle databases, SAP HANA |

## What are spot instances in AWS EC2

AWS EC2 **Spot Instances** are spare compute capacity offered by AWS at significantly reduced prices compared to On-Demand instances, sometimes up to 90% cheaper. These instances are ideal for workloads that are fault-tolerant and can handle interruptions, as Spot Instances can be terminated by AWS when the demand for On-Demand instances increases.

### **Key Features of Spot Instances:**

1. **Cost Savings**: Spot instances are priced dynamically based on supply and demand. This can lead to substantial savings for workloads that can tolerate interruptions.  
2. **Availability**: Spot instances are only available when AWS has excess capacity. When demand for EC2 capacity increases, AWS may reclaim Spot instances with just a 2-minute notice.  
3. **Flexible Pricing**: You can set a "maximum price" you're willing to pay, and EC2 will maintain the Spot instance as long as the current Spot price remains below your bid.

### **When to Use Spot Instances:**

* **Batch Processing**: For applications such as big data analytics, media encoding, and financial modeling, where tasks can be re-run if interrupted.  
* **Stateless Web Servers**: You can use Spot Instances for scaling web services that can tolerate interruptions and restart with minimal impact.  
* **CI/CD Pipelines**: For tasks like code compilation, testing, and building, where intermittent availability is acceptable.  
* **Distributed Computing**: For large-scale simulations and machine learning workloads, Spot instances can provide cost-effective computation for model training.  
* **Data Processing**: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs, Hadoop workloads, and other data-intensive tasks that are resilient to interruptions.

### **Example Use Case:**

If you're running a machine learning model training job that can be checkpointed periodically, using **Spot Instances** is a cost-effective choice. You could save on the cost of expensive GPU instances while maintaining flexibility to pause and resume your workload when Spot Instances become available again.

### **Integration with Other EC2 Instance Types:**

* **Spot Fleet**: This allows you to create a fleet of Spot instances (and even On-Demand instances) to fulfill a specified capacity. It automatically adjusts to maintain that capacity across different instance types and availability zones.  
* **Auto Scaling with Spot Instances**: You can set up an Auto Scaling group that uses Spot Instances along with On-Demand instances to ensure availability while optimizing cost.

### **Key Considerations:**

* **Interruption Handling**: Since Spot instances can be interrupted, applications need to be designed to handle sudden terminations, such as by saving progress frequently or using distributed systems where individual instance failures do not impact the overall job.  
* **Flexibility**: Spot instances are better suited for stateless applications that don’t rely on long-lived connections or continuous uptime.

By using Spot Instances, you can optimize cost for workloads that are flexible and can tolerate interruptions, making them a valuable part of an overall cloud cost management strategy.

## What are reserved instances and reserved hosts?

### **1\. Reserved Instances (RIs)**

#### **Key Features:**

* **Commitment**: You commit to using a specific instance type, in a specific region, for a 1-year or 3-year term.  
* **Discount**: Savings up to 72% over On-Demand pricing, depending on the payment option (No upfront, Partial upfront, All upfront).  
* **Flexibility**: Reserved Instances can be Standard or Convertible.  
  * **Standard Reserved Instances**: Provide the greatest discount but have limited flexibility. You cannot modify the instance family or region, but you can change availability zones and instance size.  
  * **Convertible Reserved Instances**: Offer slightly less savings but allow for instance family, size, and OS changes.  
* **Availability**: You are guaranteed capacity for the instance type you reserve within the chosen Availability Zone.

#### **When to Use Reserved Instances:**

* **Predictable, Steady-State Workloads**: For applications with stable and consistent usage, such as databases or enterprise applications, where you know you'll need continuous compute capacity.  
* **Example**:  
  * You run a production MySQL database 24/7 that requires consistent compute power. Using a `db.m5.large` **Reserved Instance** will lock in the compute capacity and provide a significant discount over On-Demand pricing.  
* **Example**: A company with a predictable web server workload (e.g., a CRM system) running 24/7 might reserve a `t3.medium` instance in the region they operate to save costs.

#### **Key Benefits:**

* **Lower Cost**: Best for predictable, long-term usage.  
* **Capacity Reservation**: RIs provide a capacity reservation if specified within a specific Availability Zone, ensuring that resources will be available when needed.

---

### **2\. Reserved Hosts**

#### **Key Features:**

* **Dedicated Physical Server**: Reserved Hosts provide a dedicated EC2 server for your exclusive use, giving full control over instance placement, licensing, and compliance.  
* **Long-Term Commitment**: Similar to Reserved Instances, you commit to a 1- or 3-year term for the reserved host.  
* **License Management**: Ideal for customers using BYOL (Bring Your Own License) for software such as Microsoft Windows or SQL Server, where you need to run software on specific hardware due to licensing restrictions.  
* **Capacity Flexibility**: You control how many instances are running on the dedicated host (unlike RIs where you're reserving a specific instance type).

#### **When to Use Reserved Hosts:**

* **Compliance and Licensing Requirements**: For organizations with strict security, compliance, or software licensing requirements that require dedicated hardware.  
* **Example**:  
  * You are a financial services company needing to comply with stringent data privacy regulations. By using a **Reserved Host**, you ensure no other AWS customers share your hardware, enhancing compliance and security.  
* **Example**: A company with Windows Server and SQL Server licenses might use Reserved Hosts to comply with Microsoft licensing requirements by running the instances on a dedicated physical server.

#### **Key Benefits:**

* **Dedicated Environment**: For companies that require complete control over hardware for compliance, licensing, or security reasons.  
* **Custom Licensing**: Useful when dealing with software licenses that are bound to physical hardware, such as Oracle or certain versions of Windows Server.  
* **Instance Flexibility**: You have the flexibility to launch any instance type that is supported by the hardware of the host (e.g., you can run multiple instance types on the same host as long as they fit the capacity).

## Elastic IP (EIP)

An **Elastic IP (EIP)** in AWS is a **static public IPv4 address** designed for dynamic cloud computing. It allows you to maintain a fixed IP address for your resources, such as an EC2 instance, even if you stop and restart the instance. This is useful for applications that require a consistent IP address.

### **Key Features:**

1. **Static**: Unlike the default public IP address assigned to an EC2 instance, which changes every time the instance is stopped and started, an Elastic IP remains constant.  
2. **Reassociation**: You can detach an Elastic IP from one resource and reassign it to another resource (e.g., if the original EC2 instance fails, you can quickly remap the IP to another instance).  
3. **Charge**:  
   * You are not charged for an Elastic IP if it is actively associated with a running instance.  
   * AWS charges for Elastic IPs that are allocated but **not in use** (to discourage wasting public IPs).

## Placement Groups

**EC2 Placement Groups** are a feature in AWS that influence how Amazon EC2 instances are placed on the underlying hardware. They are used to optimize performance, availability, or fault tolerance for specific workloads. 

| Feature | Cluster Placement Group | Spread Placement Group | Partition Placement Group |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Instance Proximity** | Close together | Spread across hardware | Divided into isolated partitions |
| **Risk of Failure** | Higher (single rack failure) | Lower (isolated hardware) | Medium (partition-level isolation) |
| **Availability Zones** | Single AZ | Single or Multiple AZs | Single or Multiple AZs |
| **Use Case** | HPC, low-latency workloads | Critical applications | Distributed databases |
| **Maximum Instances** | No specific limit | 7 per AZ | Varies based on partition size |

### **Example Use Cases**

1. **Cluster Placement Group**:  
   * You are running a real-time trading application that requires low-latency communication between servers. A Cluster Placement Group ensures all servers are on the same hardware, minimizing latency.  
2. **Spread Placement Group**:  
   * You are deploying a database cluster where each node is critical to the application’s operation. By using a Spread Placement Group, you ensure that no two nodes are placed on the same hardware, reducing the risk of correlated failures.  
3. **Partition Placement Group**:  
   * You are running a Cassandra cluster with multiple nodes storing replicated data. A Partition Placement Group ensures each node in the same partition operates independently on separate hardware, reducing the impact of hardware failures on your system.

## EC2 Storage

AWS provides various storage options for EC2 instances to support diverse use cases. The three key storage types are **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**, **EFS (Elastic File System)**, and **AMI-backed instance storage**. Here’s an overview of each:

---

### **1\. Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)**

#### **What is it?**

* A **block-level storage service** designed for use with EC2 instances. It provides persistent, high-performance storage that can be attached to one EC2 instance at a time.

#### **Key Features:**

* **Persistence**: Data persists independently of the lifecycle of the EC2 instance.  
* **Scalable**: You can resize volumes as needed.  
* **Flexible**: Supports multiple volume types (e.g., General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, Throughput Optimized HDD).  
* **Snapshots**: Allows you to back up EBS volumes to Amazon S3.

#### **Use Cases:**

* Databases, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.  
* High-performance applications requiring block storage.  
* Boot volumes for EC2 instances.

#### **Example:**

* Use **EBS General Purpose SSD (gp3)** for a web application’s storage, or **Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)** for an I/O-intensive database.

### **Choosing the Right Volume Type**

* **gp3**: Default choice for most general-purpose workloads.  
* **io2**: For high-performance databases or critical workloads requiring high IOPS and durability.  
* **st1**: For cost-effective big data processing with high throughput.  
* **sc1**: For long-term archival or infrequently accessed data.

By selecting the right EBS volume type, you can optimize cost and performance for your specific application needs.

Solid state drive (SSD) backed volumes optimized for transactional workloads involving frequent read/write operations with small I/O size, where the dominant performance attribute is IOPS.

Hard disk drive (HDD) backed volumes optimized for large streaming workloads where throughput (measured in MiB/s) is a better performance measure than IOPS.

Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) and Cold HDD (sc1) volume types CANNOT be used as a boot volume, so these two options are correct.

#### EBS Volume Types & Their Use Cases 💾🚀

Amazon **Elastic Block Store (EBS)** offers different **volume types** optimized for **performance, durability, and cost-efficiency**.

---

#### 📌 EBS Volume Types & Use Cases

| Volume Type | Category | Performance (IOPS & Throughput) | Best Use Cases |

| **io1 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)** | **High-Performance SSD** | ✅ **Max 64,000 IOPS** ✅ **Max 1,000 MB/s throughput** | 🔹 High-performance NoSQL/Relational databases 🔹 Latency-sensitive applications (**Replaced by io2**) |
| **st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD)** | **HDD for Streaming Workloads** | ✅ **Max 500 IOPS** ✅ **Max 500 MB/s throughput** | 🔹 **Big data workloads** 🔹 Log processing 🔹 Data warehouses |
| **sc1 (Cold HDD)** | **HDD for Cold Storage** | ✅ **Max 250 IOPS** ✅ **Max 250 MB/s throughput** | 🔹 **Long-term archival** 🔹 Large infrequent data access 🔹 Backup storage |
| **magnetic (standard, legacy)** | **Legacy HDD** | ✅ **Up to 40–200 IOPS** ✅ **Max 90 MB/s throughput** | 🔹 **Low-cost, infrequent workloads** 🔹 Not recommended for new workloads |

---

#### 📌 Which EBS Volumes Can Be Used as Root Volumes?

✅ **Supported Root Volumes:**

* **gp3** (Recommended)  
* **gp2**  
* **io1** / **io2**  
* **magnetic (legacy, not recommended)**

🚫 **HDD-based volumes (st1, sc1) cannot be used as root volumes** since they are optimized for sequential workloads, not boot operations.

---

### **2\. Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)**

#### **What is it?**

* A **managed file storage service** for use with EC2 instances and other AWS services. It provides a **shared file system** accessible by multiple instances simultaneously.

#### **Key Features:**

* **Scalable**: Automatically grows and shrinks as you add or remove files.  
* **Multi-AZ Access**: Data is stored across multiple Availability Zones, ensuring high availability and durability.  
* **Elastic**: No need to provision storage capacity.  
* **NFS Protocol**: Supports the standard Network File System (NFS) protocol.  
* Only linux based AMI can mount it.  
* You can set lifecycle policy to move to EFS Infrequent Access.  
* One zone AZ is also available from default Multi AZ

#### **Use Cases:**

* Content management systems.  
* Web serving or shared storage across a fleet of servers.  
* Machine learning or big data workloads that require shared access to files.

#### **Example:**

* Use EFS for a WordPress website, where multiple web servers need access to the same shared file system for media uploads and configuration files.

---

### **3\. Amazon Machine Image (AMI) Storage**

#### **What is it?**

* **AMI-backed instance storage** refers to the root storage volumes used to launch EC2 instances. AMIs can be backed by either EBS or **Instance Store**.

#### **AMI Storage Options:**

1. **EBS-Backed AMIs**:  
   * Root volume is an EBS volume.  
   * Persistent storage: Data remains after instance termination if configured.  
   * Allows stopping and restarting the instance.  
2. **Instance Store-Backed AMIs**:  
   * Root volume is ephemeral and tied to the physical disk of the host machine.  
   * Non-persistent: Data is lost when the instance is stopped or terminated.  
   * High I/O performance but no durability.

#### **Use Cases:**

* **EBS-Backed AMI**:  
  * Applications requiring persistent data storage (e.g., production workloads).  
* **Instance Store-Backed AMI**:  
  * Temporary workloads like caching, temporary data processing, or scratch space.

#### **Example:**

* Use an **EBS-backed AMI** to store an OS and application for a long-running web server. Use **Instance Store** for a high-speed cache in a big data job.

## ELB and ASG

### **Overview of Load Balancers**

| Load Balancer Type | Purpose | Layer | Protocol Support | Key Use Case |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** | Designed for web applications, works at the **application layer (Layer 7\)**. | Layer 7 | HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket, gRPC | Routing traffic for microservices or dynamic web applications based on URL paths or headers. |
| **Network Load Balancer (NLB)** | Optimized for **low latency and high throughput**, works at the **network layer (Layer 4\)**. | Layer 4 | TCP, UDP, TLS | Handling millions of requests per second for gaming apps, messaging systems, or IoT workloads. |
| **Gateway Load  Balancer (GWLB)** | Designed to route traffic to **virtual appliances** (e.g., firewalls, intrusion detection systems). | Layer 3 (Network Layer) | IP-based traffic | Scaling traffic inspection or security appliances across multiple VPCs or regions. |

### AWS Load Balancer Controller

AWS **Load Balancer Controller** is an **open-source Kubernetes controller** that manages **AWS Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)** for **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** and **Kubernetes clusters on AWS**. It automates the creation and configuration of **Application Load Balancers (ALB)** and **Network Load Balancers (NLB)** for Kubernetes services.

## 

## Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)

Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs) in AWS allow dynamic scaling of EC2 instances based on predefined **scaling policies**. These policies determine how and when the ASG should add or remove instances to match workload requirements.

---

### **Types of Scaling Policies in ASG**

| Scaling Policy | Description | Use Case | Example |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Target Tracking Scaling** | Maintains a specific metric at a target value (e.g., CPU utilization). | When you want to keep a metric stable, such as maintaining average CPU utilization at 50%. | Scale-out when average CPU utilization exceeds 50%; scale-in when it drops below. |
| **Step Scaling** | Scales the ASG by a defined number of instances when a metric crosses a specified threshold. | When you need fine-grained control over scaling based on the intensity of metric breaches. | Add 2 instances if CPU \> 70%, add 3 if CPU \> 90%; remove 1 instance if CPU \< 40%. |
| **Simple Scaling** | Adds or removes instances based on a single alarm condition. | When you want basic scaling based on simple metric thresholds without complex logic. | Add 1 instance when CPU \> 80%; remove 1 instance when CPU \< 30%. |
| **Scheduled Scaling** | Scales the ASG at specific times or on a recurring schedule. | When you know workload patterns, such as traffic spikes during business hours or batch processing at night. | Add 3 instances every day at 8 AM; remove 3 instances at 6 PM. |
| **Predictive Scaling** | Uses AWS’s machine learning models to predict future demand and scale resources proactively. | When your workloads have predictable traffic patterns (e.g., regular spikes during specific times or seasons). | Scale-out before an expected traffic surge during a marketing campaign or holiday season. |

### **Launch Configuration vs. Launch Template in AWS Auto Scaling**

Both **Launch Configurations** and **Launch Templates** define **EC2 instance settings** for Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), but **Launch Templates are the modern and recommended option**.

---

## **AWS S3**

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Your applications can easily achieve thousands of transactions per second in request performance when uploading and retrieving storage from Amazon S3. Amazon S3 automatically scales to high request rates. For example, your application can achieve at least **3,500 PUT/COPY/POST/DELETE** or **5,500 GET/HEAD** requests per second per prefix in a bucket.

There are no limits to the number of prefixes in a bucket. You can increase your read or write performance by parallelizing reads. For example, if you create 10 prefixes in an Amazon S3 bucket to parallelize reads, you could scale your read performance to 55,000 read requests per second. Please see this example for more clarity on prefixes: if you have a file f1 stored in an S3 object path like so s3://your\_bucket\_name/folder1/sub\_folder\_1/f1, then /folder1/sub\_folder\_1/ becomes the prefix for file f1.

### Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA)

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration (Amazon S3TA) enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and an S3 bucket. Transfer Acceleration takes advantage of Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed edge locations. As the data arrives at an edge location, data is routed to Amazon S3 over an optimized network path.

Multipart upload allows you to upload a single object as a set of parts. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object's data. You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object. If you're uploading large objects over a stable high-bandwidth network, use multipart uploading to maximize the use of your available bandwidth by uploading object parts in parallel for multi-threaded performance. If you're uploading over a spotty network, use multipart uploading to increase resiliency to network errors by avoiding upload restarts.
